## Introduction

[Password Generator Pro][website-url] is a tool that automatically creates a
strong, unique and random password for you. This is useful because it can be
difficult to come up with a strong, secure password on your own, and using
Password Generator Pro ensures that your password will be unique and difficult
for others to guess.

You will have the option to specify the length and complexity of the password,
such as including the number of words and a separator.

Password Generator Pro will then create a password for you based on these
specifications. You can then use this password to protect your online accounts
and keep your personal information safe.
